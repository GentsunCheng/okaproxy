## [0.x.x] - Node.js Legacy Version

### Context
The original OkaProxy was written in Node.js and provided basic proxy functionality with DoS protection. Key limitations of the legacy version included:

- Limited performance under high load
- Basic rate limiting implementation
- Minimal security features
- Limited configuration options
- No comprehensive logging

### Legacy Features (Node.js)
- Basic HTTP proxy functionality
- Simple DoS protection
- Cookie-based verification
- Redis integration for rate limiting
- Basic logging capabilities

### Migration Notes
Users migrating from the Node.js version should note:

1. **Configuration Changes**: 
   - Configuration format changed from JavaScript to TOML
   - Some configuration keys have been renamed for clarity
   - New configuration options added

2. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Improved token generation and verification
   - Additional security headers
   - Better bot detection

3. **Performance**:
   - Significantly improved performance and scalability
   - Better resource utilization
   - More efficient Redis operations

4. **Deployment**:
   - New Docker images available
   - Improved deployment options
   - Better monitoring capabilities

### Breaking Changes from Node.js Version
- Configuration file format changed from JavaScript to TOML
- Some API endpoints may have different response formats
- Log format has been structured and enhanced
- Different binary name and command-line arguments

### Migration Guide
See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) for detailed migration instructions from the Node.js version.

## Version History Summary

| Version | Language | Release Date | Key Features |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 1.0.0   | Go       | 2024-01-XX   | Complete rewrite, enhanced performance |
| 0.x.x   | Node.js  | 2023-XX-XX   | Original implementation |

## Upgrade Instructions

### From Node.js Version (0.x.x) to Go Version (1.0.0)

1. **Backup Current Setup**
   ```bash
   cp config.toml config.toml.backup
   ```

2. **Install Go Version**
   ```bash
   # Using binary release
   wget https://github.com/GentsunCheng/okaproxy/releases/latest/download/okaproxy-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   tar xzf okaproxy-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   
   # Or using Docker
   docker pull okaproxy:latest
   ```

3. **Migrate Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Convert Node.js config to TOML format
   # See MIGRATION.md for detailed conversion guide
   ```

4. **Test New Setup**
   ```bash
   # Test configuration
   ./okaproxy --config config.toml --dry-run
   
   # Start with new version
   ./okaproxy --config config.toml
